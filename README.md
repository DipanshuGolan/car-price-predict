# Car Price Prediction:

## Demo
Link: [https://car-price-prediction-golan.herokuapp.com/predict](https://car-price-prediction-golan.herokuapp.com/predict)


## Overview
This is a flask web app which predicts the price of used Cars trained on the top of Random Forest Regressor model. The dataset contains information about used cars is taken from   Kaggle listed on www.cardekho.com. The trained model takes a data of used cars as a input and predict the Price of the Car as a output.

## Technical Aspect:
This project is divided into two parts:
1) Trained a Machine Learning model using Random Forest Regressor(Code is available in this repo)
2) Deployed the model using Flask on Heroku Platform.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7.9. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
